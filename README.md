# Baseline Communities Project
<strong> Geoprocessing automation for Communities baseline Surveys project.</strong>  </br> </br>
The valuations division of The Ministry of Finance in Trinidad is responsible for the valuation of properties. This involves site visits by field assessors to individual properties in order collect information that informs the assessment of a value. Field maps for ArcGIS is used with maps prepared by the GIS department. </br>
This coding project shows some of the code used for the automation of geoprocessing related to the creation of individual community-based field maps for use in site visit data collection.
The individual communities are separated along with their roads and building points from the main feature classes containing the communities, roads and building points for the entire country. This code was written by me (Shakeel Hosein).
