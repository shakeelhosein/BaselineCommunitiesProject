The valuations division of The Ministry of Finance in Trinidad is responsible for the valuation of properties. 
This coding project shows some of the code used for the automation of geoprocessing related to the creation of individual community-based field maps for use in site visit data collection.
The individual communities are separated along with their roads and building points from the main feature classes containing the communities, roads and building points for the entire country.
